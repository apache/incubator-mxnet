## autodp: A package to automate differential privacy computation

Highlights:

1. An RDP based analytical Moment Accountant implementation that is numerically stable.
2. Supports privacy amplification for generic RDP algorithm for subsampling without replacement and poisson sampling.
3. A privacy calibrator that numerically calibrates noise to privacy requirements using RDP.
