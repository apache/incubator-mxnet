Variational Auto Encoder
========================

This folder contains a tutorial which implements the Variational Auto Encoder in MXNet using the MNIST handwritten digit
recognition dataset. Model built is referred from [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114/)
paper.

This network architecture uses Gaussian MLP as an encoder and Bernoulli MLP as a decoder.

Prerequisites:
To run this example, we need:
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html)
- Matplotlib

You can run the jupyter notebook cell by cell.

This paper also talks about Evidence Lower Bound(ELBO).
