# Visualzing CNN decisions

This folder contains an MXNet Gluon implementation of [Grad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) that helps visualize CNN decisions.

A tutorial on how to use this from Jupyter notebook is available [here](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/vision/cnn_visualization.html).
