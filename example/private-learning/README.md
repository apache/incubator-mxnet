## Differentially private deep learning 

# This example illustrates how to use with `mxnet` `gluon` and `pydiffpriv` to do DPDL

To use this example, you need to install pydiffpriv first using

`pip install pydiffpriv --upgrade`

If you do not have a GPU, just modify the line and specify the context to be mx.cpu().
