# Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)

An example of the binary RBM learning the MNIST data. The RBM is implemented as a custom operator, and a gluon block is also provided. `binary_rbm.py` contains the implementation of the RBM. `binary_rbm_module.py` and `binary_rbm_gluon.py` train the MNIST data using the module interface and the gluon interface respectively. The MNIST data is downloaded automatically.
