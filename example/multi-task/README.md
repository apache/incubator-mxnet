# Mulit-task learning example

This is a simple example to show how to use mxnet for multi-task learning. It uses MNIST as an example and mocks up the multi-label task.

## Note

The codes use `simple-bind` in the implementation. You could also refer to the [simple-bind example](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/notebooks/simple_bind.ipynb)
