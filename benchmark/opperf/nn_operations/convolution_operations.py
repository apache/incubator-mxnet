""" Performance benchmark tests for MXNet Gluon Convolution Layers

TODO

1. Conv1D
2. Conv2D
3. Conv1DTranspose
4. Conv2DTranspose

NOTE: Number of warmup and benchmark runs for convolution may need to be reduced as the computation
is heavy and within first 25 runs results stabilizes without variation.
