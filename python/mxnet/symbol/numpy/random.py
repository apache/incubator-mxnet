    Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
    ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
    any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
    by `uniform`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : float, optional
        Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
    high : float
        Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a scalar tensor containing a single value is returned if
        ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
    dtype : {'float16', 'float32', 'float64'}, optional
        Data type of output samples. Default is 'float32'
    ctx : Context, optional
        Device context of output. Default is current context.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Store output to an existing ndarray.

    Returns
    -------
    out : _Symbol (symbol representing `mxnet.numpy.ndarray` in computational graphs)
        Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.

    r"""
    normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None, dtype='float32', ctx=None, out=None)

    Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

    The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
    derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
    independently [1]_, is often called the bell curve because of
    its characteristic shape (see the example below).

    The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
    describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
    by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
    unique distribution [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loc : float, optional
        Mean (centre) of the distribution.
    scale : float, optional
        Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
        samples are drawn. If size is `None` (default), a scalar tensor containing
        a single value is returned if loc and scale are both scalars.
    dtype : {'float16', 'float32', 'float64'}, optional
        Data type of output samples. Default is 'float32'
    ctx : None or mxnet.cpu() or mxnet.gpu(gpuid), optional
        Device context to put the created array in.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Store output to an existing ndarray.

    Returns
    -------
    out : _Symbol (symbol representing `mxnet.numpy.ndarray` in computational graphs)
        Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    This function currently does not support ``loc`` and ``scale`` as `_Symbol`s.
    The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is

    .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
                     e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },
    
    where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard
    deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`,
    is called the variance.
    
    The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
    the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
    :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
    `numpy.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to
    the mean, rather than those far away.

    This function differs from the original numpy.random.normal in the following aspects:
    
        - Argument must be named from the fourth.
