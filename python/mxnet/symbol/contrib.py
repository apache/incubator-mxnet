def rand_log_uniform(true_classes, num_sampled, range_max):
    """Draw random samples from an approximately log-uniform or Zipfian distribution.

    This operation randomly samples *num_sampled* candidates the range of integers [0, range_max).
    The elements of sampled_candidates are drawn with replacement from the base distribution.

    The base distribution for this operator is an approximately log-uniform or Zipfian distribution:

    P(class) = (log(class + 2) - log(class + 1)) / log(range_max + 1)

    This sampler is useful when the true classes approximately follow such a distribution.
    For example, if the classes represent words in a lexicon sorted in decreasing order of \
    frequency. If your classes are not ordered by decreasing frequency, do not use this op.

    Additionaly, it also returns the number of times each of the \
    true classes and the sampled classes is expected to occur.

    Parameters
    ----------
    true_classes : Symbol
        The target classes in 1-D.
    num_sampled: int
        The number of classes to randomly sample.
    range_max: int
        The number of possible classes.

    Returns
    -------
    list of Symbols
        A 1-D `int64` `Symbol` for sampled candidate classes, a 1-D `float64` `Symbol` for \
        the expected count for true classes, and a 1-D `float64` `Symbol` for the \
        expected count for sampled classes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> true_cls = mx.nd.array([3])
    >>> samples, exp_count_true, exp_count_sample = mx.nd.contrib.rand_log_uniform(true_cls, 4, 5)
    >>> samples

    >>> exp_count_true
