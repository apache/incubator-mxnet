    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like

    axis : int, optional

def _np_sum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, keepdims=False, initial=None, out=None):

    Sum of array elements over a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int, optional
        Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input array.  If
        axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed. The default type is float32.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `sum` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-classes `sum` method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial: Currently only supports None as input, optional
        Starting value for the sum.
        Currently not implemented. Please use ``None`` as input or skip this argument.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape and dtype as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_axis : ndarray
        An ndarray with the same shape as `a`, with the specified
        axis removed. If an output array is specified, a reference to

    Notes
    -----
    - Input type does not support Python native iterables.
    - "out" param: cannot perform auto type change. out ndarray's dtype must be the same as the expected output.
    - "initial" param is not supported yet. Please use None as input.
    - Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on overflow.
    - The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:

    >>> a = np.empty(1)
    >>> np.sum(a)
    array(0.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If

    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,

        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'

def _np__linalg_svd(a):
    r"""
    Singular Value Decomposition.

    When `a` is a 2D array, it is factorized as ``ut @ np.diag(s) @ v``,
    where `ut` and `v` are 2D orthonormal arrays and `s` is a 1D
    array of `a`'s singular values. When `a` is higher-dimensional, SVD is
    applied in stacked mode as explained below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, N) ndarray 
        A real or complex array with ``a.ndim >= 2`` and ``M <= N``.

    Returns
    -------
    ut: (..., M, M) ndarray
        Orthonormal array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`.
    s : (..., M) ndarray
        Vector(s) with the singular values, within each vector sorted in
        descending order. The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`.
    v : (..., M, N) ndarray
        Orthonormal array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`.

    Notes
    -----

    The decomposition is performed using LAPACK routine ``_gesvd``.

    SVD is usually described for the factorization of a 2D matrix :math:`A`.
    The higher-dimensional case will be discussed below. In the 2D case, SVD is
    written as :math:`A = U^T S V`, where :math:`A = a`, :math:`U^T = ut`,
    :math:`S= \mathtt{np.diag}(s)` and :math:`V = v`. The 1D array `s`
    contains the singular values of `a` and `ut` and `v` are orthonormal. The rows
    of `v` are the eigenvectors of :math:`A^T A` and the columns of `ut` are
    the eigenvectors of :math:`A A^T`. In both cases the corresponding
    (possibly non-zero) eigenvalues are given by ``s**2``.

    If `a` has more than two dimensions, then broadcasting rules apply.
    This means that SVD is working in "stacked" mode: it iterates over 
    all indices of the first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions and for each
    combination SVD is applied to the last two indices. The matrix `a` 
    can be reconstructed from the decomposition with either 
    ``(ut * s[..., None, :]) @ v`` or
    ``ut @ (s[..., None] * v)``. (The ``@`` operator denotes batch matrix multiplication)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(54).reshape(6, 9)
    >>> ut, s, v = np.linalg.svd(a)
    >>> ut.shape, s.shape, v.shape
    ((6, 6), (6,), (6, 9))
    >>> s = s.reshape(6, 1)
    >>> ret = np.dot(ut, s * v)
    >>> (ret - a > 1e-3).sum()
    array(0.)
    >>> (ret - a < -1e-3).sum()

def _np_roll(a, shift, axis=None):
    """
    Roll array elements along a given axis.
    
    Elements that roll beyond the last position are re-introduced at

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    shift : int or tuple of ints
        The number of places by which elements are shifted.  If a tuple,
        then `axis` must be a tuple of the same size, and each of the
        given axes is shifted by the corresponding number.  If an int
        while `axis` is a tuple of ints, then the same value is used for
        all given axes.
    axis : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which elements are shifted.  By default, the

        Input array, from which the diagonals are taken.
    offset : int, optional
        Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal. Can be both positive
        and negative. Defaults to 0.
    axis1, axis2 : int, optional
        Axes to be used as the first and second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays
        from which the diagonals should be taken. Defaults are the first two
        axes of `a`.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Array into which the output is placed. It must be of the right shape
        and right type to hold the output.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_diagonals : ndarray
        If `a` is 2-D, the sum along the diagonal is returned.  If `a` has
        larger dimensions, then an array of sums along diagonals is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    >>> np.trace(a)
    array(3.)
    >>> a = np.arange(8).reshape((2, 2, 2))
    >>> np.trace(a)
    array([6., 8.])
    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape((2, 2, 2, 3))
    >>> np.trace(a).shape

def _np_squeeze(a, axis=None, out=None):

    Remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Selects a subset of the single-dimensional entries in the
        shape. If an axis is selected with shape entry greater than
        one, an error is raised.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Array into which the output is placed. It must have the same size
        and dtype as the input array.

    Returns
    -------
    squeezed : ndarray
        The input array, but with all or a subset of the
        dimensions of length 1 removed. It always returns a copy of `a`.

    Raises
    ------
    MXNetError
        If `axis` is not `None`, and an axis being squeezed is not of length 1

def _np_moveaxis(a, source, destination):
    """Move axes of an array to new positions.
    Other axes remain in their original order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The array whose axes should be reordered.
        source : int or sequence of int
        Original positions of the axes to move. These must be unique.
        destination : int or sequence of int
        Destination positions for each of the original axes. These must also be
        unique.
