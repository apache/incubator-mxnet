def _np_reshape(a, newshape, order='C'):
    """
    reshape(a, newshape, order='C')

    Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'
        may be added in the future.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        It will be always a copy of the original array. This behavior is different
        from the official NumPy package where views of the original array may be
        generated.

    ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.

def _np_ones_like(a):

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.

    Returns
    -------

def _np_repeat(a, repeats, axis=None):

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the
        flattened input array, and return a flat output array.

    Returns
    -------
    repeated_array : ndarray
        Output array which has the same shape as `a`, except along
        the given axis.

def _npi_multinomial(a):
    """Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.

    The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the binomial distribution.
    Take an experiment with one of ``p`` possible outcomes. An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
    where the outcome can be 1 through 6. Each sample drawn from the distribution represents n such experiments.
    Its values, ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome was ``i``.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of experiments.
    pvals : sequence of floats, length p
        Probabilities of each of the p different outcomes. These should sum to 1
        (however, the last element is always assumed to account for the remaining
        probability, as long as ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` sam-
        ples are drawn. Default is None, in which case a single value is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The drawn samples, of shape size, if that was provided. If not, the shape is ``(N,)``.
        In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional value drawn from the distribution.
    """

def _np_cumsum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None):
    """
    Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
        precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary. See `doc.ufuncs`
        (Section "Output arguments") for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    cumsum_along_axis : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned. The
        result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if
        `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

def _np_prod(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=None):
    r"""
    prod(a, axis=None, dtype=None, keepdims=_Null, initial=None, out=None)

    Return the product of array elements over a given axis.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a product is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will calculate the product of all the elements in the
        input array. If axis is negative it counts from the last to the
        first axis.
    
        If axis is a tuple of ints, a product is performed on all of the
        axes specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the
        axes as before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in
        which the elements are multiplied.  Default is numpy.float32.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
        will broadcast correctly against the input array.
    
        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `prod` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : None, optional
        Must be None.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary.
    
    Returns
    -------
    product_along_axis : ndarray, see `dtype` parameter above.

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.  That means that, on a 32-bit platform:
    
    >>> x = np.array([536870910, 536870910, 536870910, 536870910]).astype('int')
    >>> np.prod(x) 
    array(0)
 
    This function differs to the original numpy.prod in the following aspects:
        
        - Do not support empty ndarray or scalar as input.
        - Keepdims must be 0 or 1. Otherwise, an error will raise.
        - Can't cast type automatically.

    Examples
    --------
    By default, calculate the product of all elements:
    
    >>> x = np.array([1.,2.])
    >>> np.prod(x)
    array(2.)
    
    Even when the input array is two-dimensional:
    
    >>> x = np.array([[1.,2.],[3.,4.]])
    >>> np.prod(x)
    array(24.)
    
    But we can also specify the axis over which to multiply:

    >>> x = np.array([[1.,2.],[3.,4.]])
    >>> np.prod(x, axis=1)
    array([ 2., 12.])
    """
    pass

def _np__random_shuffle(x):
    r"""
    random.shuffle(x)
    
    Modify a sequence in-place by shuffling its contents.
    
    This function only shuffles the array along the first axis of a
    multi-dimensional array. The order of sub-arrays is changed but
    their contents remains the same.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        The ndarray to be shuffled.
    
    Returns
    -------
    None
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.arange(10)
    >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
    array([0., 2., 3., 5., 9., 1., 6., 8., 4., 7.])
    
    Multi-dimensional arrays are only shuffled along the first axis:
    
    >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
    >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
    array([[0., 1., 2.],
           [6., 7., 8.],
