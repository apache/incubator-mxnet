@set_module('mxnet.ndarray.numpy')
def take(a, indices, axis=None, mode='clip', out=None):
    r"""
    Take elements from an array along an axis.

    When axis is not None, this function does the same thing as "fancy"
    indexing (indexing arrays using arrays); however, it can be easier to use
    if you need elements along a given axis. A call such as
    ``np.take(arr, indices, axis=3)`` is equivalent to
    ``arr[:,:,:,indices,...]``.

    Explained without fancy indexing, this is equivalent to the following use
    of `ndindex`, which sets each of ``ii``, ``jj``, and ``kk`` to a tuple of
    indices::

        Ni, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        Nj = indices.shape
        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for jj in ndindex(Nj):
                for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                    out[ii + jj + kk] = a[ii + (indices[jj],) + kk]

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The source array.
    indices : ndarray
        The indices of the values to extract. Also allow scalars for indices.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis over which to select values. By default, the flattened
        input array is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype.
    mode : {'clip', 'wrap'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.

        * 'clip' -- clip to the range (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around

        'clip' mode means that all indices that are too large are replaced
        by the index that addresses the last element along that axis. Note
        that this disables indexing with negative numbers.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The returned array has the same type as `a`.

    Notes
    -----

    This function differs from the original `numpy.take
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.take.html>`_ in
    the following way(s):

    - Only ndarray or scalar ndarray is accepted as valid input.
    - 'raise' mode is not supported.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8])
    >>> indices = np.array([0, 1, 4])
    >>> np.take(a, indices)
    array([4., 3., 6.])

    In this example for `a` is an ndarray, "fancy" indexing can be used.

    >>> a[indices]
    array([4., 3., 6.])

    If `indices` is not one dimensional, the output also has these dimensions.

    >>> np.take(a, np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]]))
    array([[4., 3.],
           [5., 7.]])
