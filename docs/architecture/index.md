# MXNet Architecture

Building a high-performance deep learning library
requires many systems-level design decisions.
In this design note design note we share the rationale
for the specific choices made when designing _MXNet_.
We imagine these insights may be useful to both deep learning practitioners
and builders of other deep learning systems.

## Deep Learning System Design Concepts

The following pages address general design concepts for deep learning systems.
Mainly, they focus on the following 3 areas:
abstraction, optimization, and trade-offs between efficiency and flexibility.

* [Programming Models for Deep Learning](http://mxnet.io/architecture/program_model.html)
* [Dependency Engine for Deep Learning](http://mxnet.io/architecture/note_engine.html)
* [Optimizing the Memory Consumption in Deep Learning](http://mxnet.io/architecture/note_memory.html)
* [Efficient Data Loading Module for Deep Learning](http://mxnet.io/architecture/note_data_loading.html)
* [Survey of RNN Interface](http://mxnet.io/architecture/rnn_interface.html)

## MXNet System Design and Architecture

These pages specifically address the MXNet system architecture and also detail how to make modifications (and contribute!) to MXNet.

* [MXNet System Overview](http://mxnet.io/architecture/overview.html)
* [How to Read the Code](http://mxnet.io/architecture/read_code.html)
* [Develop and Hack MXNet](http://mxnet.io/how_to/develop_and_hack.html)
* [How to Contribute to MXNet](http://mxnet.io/community/contribute.html)
