# MXNet - Java Inference API

MXNet supports Java for performing inference on a trained model. The aim of the MXNet Java package is to provide an efficient and easy to use inference API.
The MXNet Java package makes it easy to quickly deploy an existing model into a production level Java ecosystem.

See the [Java Infer API javadocs](../../docs/index.html#org.apache.mxnet.infer.package) for detailed API information and the [tutorial page](../../tutorials/index.html) for detailed tutorials and examples using the Java Inference API.
