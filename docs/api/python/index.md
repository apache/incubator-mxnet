MXNet provides a rich Python API is one of most popular front-end languages MXNet supports.
In this section we provide a in-depth discussion of the various MXNet Python packages and the
functionality they provide. We have made an attempt to include code samples for most of the APIs
for improved clarity. These code sample will run as-is as long we you first import MXNet by running

```
>>> import mxnet as mx
```

```eval_rst

.. note:: A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of
    Jupyter notebook, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples contains
