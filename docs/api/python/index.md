# MXNet - Python API

MXNet provides a rich Python API to serve a broad community of Python developers.
In this section we provide a in-depth discussion of various MXNet Python packages and the
functionality they provide. We have included code samples for most of the APIs
for improved clarity. These code samples will run as-is as long as MXNet is first imported by running

```
>>> import mxnet as mx
```

```eval_rst

.. note:: The code examples in API docs are written in a python-console format.
    These examples can be executed in Jupyter notebook by using %doctest_mode.
    Simply copy and paste the example directly into Jupyter notebook without
    having to worry about removing the >>> manually.
