# MXNet - Python API

MXNet provides a rich Python API to serve a broad community of Python developers.
In this section we provide a in-depth discussion of various MXNet Python packages and the
functionality they provide. We have included code samples for most of the APIs
for improved clarity. These code samples will run as-is as long as MXNet is first imported by running

```
>>> import mxnet as mx
```

### For Jupyter Notebook Users:

.. note:: A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of
    Jupyter notebook, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples contains
    ``>>>`` and preserves indentation. Run ``%doctest_mode?`` in Jupyter notebook
    for more details.
